# Expectation Management & Cross-Functional Collaboration (Task 3)

Context:
You have two tasks above (Task 1 & Task 2). Take tomorrow’s date as the original due date for
both tasks. There is a family emergency at your place due to which you won’t be able to meet
the due date of the above tasks for at least 3 more days. Task 1 is for a low-priority customer
who has not provided any go-live date to us. Task 2 is for a priority customer whose campaign
needs to go live in the next 2 days.


## Approach to Solving the Issue:

1. **Prioritization of the tasks:**  According to the family emergency I need the manage the tasks effectively. My Apporach would be to complete the task which has higher priority. And will inform the respective managers about the delay in completing the tasks. Then I will focus on completing the lower priority task within the given time or with little extension if needed.
  
2. **Communication with Account Managers:** I will be in constant touch with both the account managers to explain the situation and the approach by which I am completing the tasks and to maintain the transprancy in the work.

3. **Management of Tasks:** since the Task2 is the high priority task with tight timeline, I would try to complete atleast this tasks within the time.  and then if possible then would be completing the task1 as well within the time limit or with some extension.
